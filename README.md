# Dimensional Modelling and Visualization of SP500 Dataset – Data Warehousing Project
• Designed a Dimensional model – Star Schema with a fact table and five dimensions in Vertabelo.
• Built the Oracle database and implemented analytical queries like Pearson Correlation, Moving Averages, Aggregation with Cubes and Rollup, Bins using NTILE etc.
• Worked on a Story narrative and visualized the model analytically and geographically using Qlik Sense/ QlikView.
